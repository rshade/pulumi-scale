# Pulumi Scale Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality & Standards
Code must be idiomatic, maintainable, and clean. Linting and static analysis are mandatory for all contributions.

### II. Testing Strategy (TDD & Integration)
Test Driven Development (Red-Green-Refactor) is non-negotiable for logic. Solid integration tests are required for all component boundaries and external interactions.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All tools and interfaces must share a consistent look, feel, and behavior. Output formats and flags must be uniform.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Systems must be designed for low latency and high efficiency. Performance regressions are treated bugs.

### V. Rigorous Planning
No code is written without a well-researched, approved plan. 'Measure twice, cut once' applies to architecture and design.

### VI. Documentation Sync
Project documentation (README, docs/) must be kept in sync with code changes. Every feature implementation must include updates to relevant documentation to prevent drift.

## Governance

All changes must follow the defined planning and review process.
